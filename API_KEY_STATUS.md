## ⚠️ **Anthropic API (Claude)**

**Status:** ⚠️ **KEY VALID BUT MODEL ACCESS LIMITED**

- **API Key:** Valid (authentication successful)
- **Issue:** Models returning "not_found_error"
- **Tested Models:**
  - ❌ `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
  - ❌ `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`
  - ❌ `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`
  - ❌ `claude-3-opus-20240229`

### Analysis:
The API key is **VALID** (confirmed by comparing authentication errors vs model errors), but the specific Claude models are not accessible. This could be due to:

1. **Account tier restrictions** - Some API keys have limited model access
2. **Model name changes** - Claude model versions may have been updated
3. **Regional restrictions** - Some models may not be available in certain regions
4. **Beta access required** - Newer models may require special access

### Impact on Project:
- **Bolt.diy Platform:** May have limited functionality for AI code generation
- **All other features:** Working normally (using Cerebras as primary)

### Recommendations:
1. **Check Anthropic Console:** Visit https://console.anthropic.com to see available models
2. **Verify Account Tier:** Ensure account has access to required models
3. **Alternative:** Bolt.diy can work with other providers (Google, OpenAI, etc.)
4. **Fallback:** System continues working with Cerebras for main AI agents

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

### To Fix Anthropic API:
1. Log into https://console.anthropic.com
2. Check "API Keys" section for model access
3. Verify account billing/credits
4. Check available models in documentation
5. Update model names in Bolt.diy configuration if needed

### To Continue Without Fix:
The system works perfectly with Cerebras as the primary AI engine. Anthropic/Claude is only needed for Bolt.diy code generation features.
